# SelfishMiningSimulator

This project contains a class file block.h and block.cpp which defines the block in blockchain

twoHonest.cpp is the simulation program for two honest miners

Two honest miners mine the block on only one chain. The revenue is proportion to his computation power.


oneSelfish.cpp is the simulation program for one honest and one selfish miner. One parameter hp where 1>=hp>=0 shall be added as a commend line parameter to indicate the probability that an honest miner mines the block after a selfish chain.
